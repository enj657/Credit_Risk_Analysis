# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

For this analysis, I need to solve a credit card risk challenge using machine learning. Since credit risk is an unbalanced classification problem, I need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unblanaced classes. I will use the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build models using resampling. Then, I will oversample the data using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE, and undersample the data using ClusterCentroids. I will then combine the over and undersampling methods using SMOTEENN. Lastly, I will compare two machine learning models, BalancedRandomForestClassifies and Easy EnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether these machine learning models should be used to predict credit risk.
